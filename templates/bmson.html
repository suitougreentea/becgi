    <h1 style="padding-left:3%;" id="bmson">BMS vs bmson</h1>
    <p style="padding-left:5%; width:75%; font-family: 'Alegreya Sans'">
        Both BMS and bmson have their upsides and downsides. </br>
        If you’re unfamiliar with bmson, here is an excerpt from the bmson v1.0 specification:
            <p style="padding-left:6%"><i>
                “bmson is a file format based on JSON. </br>
                Compared to BMS, it is a much easier format to handle on both artist and developer ends, </br>
                as the format expects games to slice the sound stems during play rather than artists having to do all this work beforehand. </br>
                This also removes the limit of keysounds you can have in a single chart, </br>
                as well as it lets chart creators to use any part of any sound they want.” </br>
            </i></p>
    <p style="padding-left:5%; width:75%; font-family: 'Alegreya Sans'">
        bmson was initially developed by <a href=https://twitter.com/wosderge>wosderge</a>, hoping it would be used by many. </br>
        Thus to help in his agenda, we allow the submission of bmson files in this event. </br>
        Unlike BMS, bmson has <b>no keysound limit</b>. This means you can have as many playable sounds as you wish. </br>
        The way keysounds are chopped up are up to the chart creator as opposed to the artist. </br>
        Instead of having to export every single keysound individually, you can instead export full length stems. No length limit. </br>
        This makes the whole process of creating keysounds (playable sounds) much easier. </br>
        However, bmson has a major drawback. </br>
        Due to bmson being fairly new, it’s largest downside is it’s lack of support. </br>
        As of writing this, only 3 games support bmson, those being: </br>
            <ul style="padding-left:10%; width:75%; font-family: 'Alegreya Sans'">
                <li><a href=https://github.com/zardoru/raindrop/releases>raindrop</a> by Agka</li>
                <li><a href=https://bemuse.ninja/>Bemuse</a> by flicknote</li>
                <li><a href=http://circularrhythm.github.io/>CircularRhythm</a> by suitougreentea</li>
            </ul>
    <p style="padding-left:5%; width:75%; font-family: 'Alegreya Sans'">
        It also only has two editors:
            <ul style="padding-left:10%; width:75%; font-family: 'Alegreya Sans'">
                <li><a href=http://cerebralmuddystream.nekokan.dyndns.info/bmson/>woseq</a> by wosderge (now oudated)</li>
                <li><a href=http://sky.geocities.jp/exclusion_bms/bmsone_en.html>BmsONE</a> by exclusion</li>
            </ul>
    <p style="padding-left:5%; width:75%; font-family: 'Alegreya Sans'">
        All of these softwares are in development, and lack many features you would find in programs such as Lunatic Rave 2 or iBMSC. </br>
        With lack of developer support, comes lack of player support. </br>
        Due to bmson being the less popular than BMS, you need to expect less traffic to your submission. </br>
